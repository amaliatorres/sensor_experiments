# AquaPlumb Sensor Experiments:

## 1. Static Water Level
The AquaPlumb sensors are mounted onto a metal rod, which is a similar scenario to a pole mount. The sensor cables have been immersed in a container filled with water of  depth 14 cm. The MCU logs the analog readings of the sensor outputs. Here below is the test setup:

Due to evaporation, the final water level is 13.5 cm.
