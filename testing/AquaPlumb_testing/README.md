# AquaPlumb Sensor Experiments:

## 1. Static Water Level:
The AquaPlumb sensors are installed onto a metal rod, which is a similar scenario to a pole mount. The sensor cables have been immersed in a container filled with water of a known depth. The MCU logs the analog readings of the sensor outputs. Here below is the test setup:
